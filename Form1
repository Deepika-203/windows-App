Windows from App
Firstly the Form1 code
IF we use the keyboard shortcuts we firstly select keypress one 

Using Keyboard shortcuts code:

Public Class Form1
    Private Sub Form1_KeyPress(sender As Object, e As KeyPressEventArgs) Handles MyBase.KeyPress
        btnViewSubmissions.ShortcutKeys = Keys.Control Or Keys.C
        btnCreateSubmission.ShortcutKeys = Keys.Control Or Keys.N
    End Sub

    Private Sub btnViewSubmissions_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnViewSubmissions.Click
        Dim viewForm As New ViewSubmissionsForm()
        viewForm.ShowDialog()
    End Sub

    Private Sub btnCreateSubmission_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCreateSubmission.Click
        Dim createForm As New CreateSubmissionForm()
        createForm.ShowDialog()
    End Sub
End Class

Without Keyboard shortcuts code:
Public Class Form1

    Private Sub btnViewSubmissions_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnViewSubmissions.Click
        Dim viewForm As New ViewSubmissionsForm()
        viewForm.ShowDialog()
    End Sub

    Private Sub btnCreateSubmission_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnCreateSubmission.Click
        Dim createForm As New CreateSubmissionForm()
        createForm.ShowDialog()
    End Sub
End Class
